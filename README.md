# ComfyUI StableCascade using diffusers

# Update: This repo is already deprecated as the native support is in ComfyUI, more info: https://gist.github.com/comfyanonymous/0f09119a342d0dd825bb2d99d19b781c

Simple quick wrapper for https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-cascade

Comfy is going to implement this properly soon, this repo is just for quick testing for the impatient!

Currently requires this diffusers branch:
`pip install git+https://github.com/kashif/diffusers.git@wuerstchen-v3`
